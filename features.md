# Supervity AP Command Center: Feature Deep Dive
### An Intelligent, End-to-End Accounts Payable Automation Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

The Supervity AP Command Center is not just a document processing tool; it is an AI-powered partner for the Accounts Payable department. It automates the entire invoice lifecycle—from ingestion and 3-way matching to payment proposal—while providing an intelligent **AP Copilot** that learns from user actions, offers proactive advice, and delivers strategic business insights.

This document provides a detailed overview of its core components and unique intelligence features.

## 2. The End-to-End AP Automation Workflow

The system is built around a robust, event-driven workflow that ensures efficiency, transparency, and continuous learning.

**Workflow Steps:**
1.  **Document Upload:** Users upload a batch of invoices, POs, and GRNs via the **Data Center**.
2.  **Job Tracking:** A processing job is created to track the batch's progress.
3.  **Intelligent Document Processing (IDP):** The system uses Google Gemini to read each PDF and extract structured data in parallel.
4.  **Data Persistence:** The extracted data is saved into the database.
5.  **Transparent 3-Way Matching:** The core engine runs, comparing invoices against POs and GRNs. Every validation step is recorded.
6.  **Dashboard & Workbench:** Approved invoices move forward, while exceptions are flagged for review in the user-friendly **Resolution Workbench**. KPIs are updated on the dashboard.
7.  **User Action & Copilot:** Users resolve exceptions, approve invoices, or ask the **AP Copilot** for analysis and assistance.
8.  **The Learning Loop:** The system observes how users resolve exceptions and creates "Learned Heuristics."
9.  **Proactive Insights:** A monitoring service analyzes system data to generate optimization alerts and automation suggestions.

## 3. The Four Pillars of the Platform

The system's capabilities are built upon four key pillars:

### I. Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)
The foundation of the system is its ability to accurately understand documents.
- **AI-Powered Extraction:** Uses Google Gemini to extract data from any PDF layout, eliminating the need for templates.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves high precision on key fields like invoice numbers, line items, dates, and totals.
- **Structured Output:** Converts unstructured PDFs into clean, structured JSON data, ready for processing.

### II. Transparent & Robust 3-Way Matching
This is the core automation engine, designed for trust and accuracy.
- **Automated Validation:** Automatically matches Invoices against Goods Receipt Notes (GRNs) and Purchase Orders (POs).
- **Comprehensive Checks:** The engine validates more than just numbers.
- **The Match Trace:** Every validation step is recorded in a detailed log. This provides **100% transparency**, showing users exactly why an invoice was approved or flagged for review.

### III. The AP Command Center
The frontend is designed for two key personas: the AP clerk focused on execution and the manager focused on performance.
- **Executive Dashboard:** A high-level view of strategic KPIs.
- **Resolution Workbench:** A power-user workspace designed for efficient exception handling. It features a work queue, a detailed dossier view (including the Match Trace and a document viewer), and the integrated AP Copilot.
- **Invoice Explorer:** A powerful search interface that allows users to perform custom queries across all invoice data and export the results.

### IV. The AP Copilot & Proactive Engine
This is what elevates the system from simple automation to an intelligent partner.
- **Conversational Interface:** Users can manage the entire AP process using natural language.
- **Tool-Augmented AI:** The Copilot can use a wide array of "tools" to interact with the database, perform actions, and generate content.
- **Proactive Intelligence:** The system doesn't just wait for commands. An internal monitoring service constantly looks for opportunities and risks.
- **Adaptive Learning:** The system learns from user actions to become smarter and more efficient over time, with learnings visible in the **Learned Insights** page.

## 4. Deep Dive: The AP Copilot's Toolkit

The Copilot's power comes from its ability to use a wide range of tools. Below is a summary of its capabilities.

| Category | Tool Name | Purpose | Example User Prompt |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Retrieval & Analysis** | `get_system_kpis` | Fetches strategic performance metrics for the entire system. | "Give me a KPI summary." |
| | `search_invoices` | Finds invoices based on specific criteria like status or vendor. | "Show me all invoices that need review." |
| | `get_invoice_details`| Retrieves the complete dossier for a single invoice. | "What's the problem with invoice INV-AM-98003?" |
| | `summarize_vendor_issues`| Analyzes and lists the most common problems for a vendor. | "What are the top issues with ArcelorMittal?" |
| | `get_learned_heuristics`| Shows the patterns the agent has learned from user actions. | "What have you learned about how we handle exceptions?" |
| | `get_notifications`| Fetches proactive alerts and suggestions from the system. | "Are there any urgent alerts I should know about?" |
| **Action & Workflow** | `approve_invoice` | Approves an invoice for payment. | "Approve INV-AM-98002." |
| | `reject_invoice` | Rejects an invoice. | "Reject this invoice due to incorrect pricing." |
| | `update_vendor_tolerance`| Sets a custom price tolerance for a specific vendor. | "Set the price tolerance for ArcelorMittal to 10%." |
| | `edit_purchase_order`| Modifies data on an existing Purchase Order. | "Change the quantity of 'Steel Beams' on PO-78001 to 12."|
| | `create_payment_proposal`| Creates a payment batch for approved invoices. | "Create a payment proposal for all invoices due this week." |
| | `create_automation_rule`| Creates a new, permanent rule for auto-processing. | "Create a rule to auto-approve invoices from 'Trusted Vendor' under $500." |
| **Generative & Communication** | `draft_vendor_communication` | Drafts a professional email to a vendor about an issue. | "Draft an email to the vendor about this quantity mismatch." |
| | `analyze_spending_by_category`| Uses AI to analyze line items and categorize spending. | "What were our top spending categories last quarter?" |

## 5. Deep Dive: The Adaptive Learning Loop

This is one of the system's most powerful and unique features. It allows the agent to learn from the implicit knowledge of the AP team.

#### How it Works:
1.  **Scenario:** The matching engine flags an invoice from "ArcelorMittal" because the price for "Steel Beams" is 8% higher than on the PO, which is outside the default 5% tolerance. The invoice status is set to `needs_review`.
2.  **User Action:** An AP clerk reviews the invoice in the Workbench. Knowing that ArcelorMittal's prices fluctuate but are generally trustworthy, they manually **approve** the invoice.
3.  **The Learning Event:** The system detects that an invoice with a `PriceMismatchException` was manually approved. It records this event as a **`LearnedHeuristic`**:
    - **Vendor:** ArcelorMittal
    - **Exception Type:** `PriceMismatchException`
    - **Condition:** The price variance was ~8%.
    - **Resolution:** `approved_for_payment`
4.  **Reinforcement:** The next time a similar scenario occurs (e.g., a 7% or 9% price mismatch for the same vendor) and the user approves it again, the system finds the existing heuristic and increases its **confidence score**.
5.  **Recommendation & Automation:** Once the confidence score for a heuristic crosses a certain threshold (e.g., 90%), two things happen:
    - **Proactive Suggestion:** The monitoring service generates a notification: *"I've noticed you consistently approve price mismatches up to 10% for ArcelorMittal. Would you like to create a formal rule to automate this?"*
    - **Smarter Matching (Future State):** The matching engine can use this high-confidence heuristic to automatically approve the invoice, logging that it did so based on a learned pattern, further increasing the touchless processing rate.

#### Business Value:
-   **Captures Tacit Knowledge:** Makes the experience of senior AP staff a reusable, digital asset.
-   **Reduces Repetitive Work:** Frees up the team from handling the same minor, vendor-specific issues over and over.
-   **Drives Continuous Improvement:** The system gets smarter and more tailored to your specific business relationships with every invoice processed.
